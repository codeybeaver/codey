my file codey.js is a program. i want to be able to run the program from anotehr program like this:

```typescript
import "codey";
```

can this be done? how do i need to update my package.json file to make this work?

```json
{
  "name": "@codeybeaver/codey",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "LLMs on the command line.",
  "main": "codey.js",

Yes, it is possible to run or use your program `codey.js` by importing it in another program using `import "codey";`, but there are a few things you need to clarify and configure to make this work as expected. Let's break this down step by step.

### What Does `import "codey";` Mean?
When you write `import "codey";`, you're telling Node.js or a bundler (like webpack or rollup) to import a module named `codey`. This could refer to:
1. A local file or module in your project.
2. A package installed from npm (or another registry) with the name `codey` or `@codeybeaver/codey` (as defined in your `package.json`).

Since your `package.json` specifies `"name": "@codeybeaver/codey"`, I'll assume you want to publish this package to npm (or a private registry) and then import it in another project. If you just want to use it locally in another file, the steps are slightly different.

### Steps to Enable Importing Your Program

#### 1. Ensure Your Module is Exportable
If you want to use `import "codey";` or `import codey from "@codeybeaver/codey";`, your `codey.js` file (or the bundled output in `dist/codey.js`) must export something. For example:
- If `codey.js` is a library, it should export functions, classes, or objects.
- If `codey.js` is a CLI program, it might not export anything directly, but you can still make it executable via the `bin` field (which you already have).

Check your `codey.js` file. If it’s a CLI program, it might not need to export anything for direct imports, but if you want to use it as a library, ensure it has something like:
```javascript
// codey.js
export function runCodey() {
  console.log("Running Codey!");
  // Your program logic here
}

export default runCodey;
```

If you’re using TypeScript, make sure the compiled output in `dist/codey.js` reflects these exports.

#### 2. Update `package.json` for Module Support
Your `package.json` already has `"type": "module"`, which indicates that your project uses ES modules (ESM). This is good because it aligns with using `import` syntax. However, let’s ensure the `main` and `exports` fields are set up correctly.

- **Update `main` Field**: Your `main` field points to `"codey.js"`, which is fine if that’s the entry point for importing. However, since you have a `bin` field pointing to `./dist/codey.js`, it might be better to align `main` with the compiled output if applicable:
  ```json
  "main": "dist/codey.js",
  ```

- **Add `exports` Field (Optional but Recommended)**: The `exports` field provides a modern way to define entry points for your package. Update your `package.json` to include:
  ```json
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "import": "./dist/codey.js",
      "require": "./dist/codey.js"
    }
  },
  ```
  This tells tools like Node.js and bundlers where to find the entry point for both ESM (`import`) and CommonJS (`require`).

#### 3. Publish Your Package (If Needed)
If you want to use `import "codey";` or `import "@codeybeaver/codey";` in another project, you need to publish your package to npm or a private registry. Since your `package.json` has `"name": "@codeybeaver/codey"`, it’s scoped, which often implies a private or organization-specific package.

- Run `npm publish --access public` (or configure a private registry) to publish your package.
- After publishing, install it in another project using:
  ```bash
  npm install @codeybeaver/codey
  ```
- Then, in your TypeScript/JavaScript file, you can use:
  ```typescript
  import codey from "@codeybeaver/codey";
  codey(); // If it exports a function
  ```

#### 4. Local Development (If Not Publishing)
If you’re not ready to publish and just want to test locally in another project, you can use `npm link` or a local file path:
- In your `codey` project directory, run:
  ```bash
  npm link
  ```
- In the other project, run:
  ```bash
  npm link @codeybeaver/codey
  ```
- Then, you can import it as if it were published:
  ```typescript
  import codey from "@codeybeaver/codey";
  ```

Alternatively, if both projects are in the same monorepo or file system, you can reference the local path directly in the other project’s `package.json`:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "@codeybeaver/codey": "file:../path/to/codey"
}
```

#### 5. Handle CLI vs. Library Use Case
Your `package.json` has a `bin` field, which suggests `codey` is meant to be a CLI tool. If you run `npm install @codeybeaver/codey -g`, you can execute it directly from the command line as `codey` (thanks to the `bin` field). However, if you want to `import` it, ensure the code in `dist/codey.js` is structured to handle both CLI execution and programmatic imports.

For example, in `codey.js`, you can use a pattern like this:
```javascript
// codey.js
export function runCodey(args) {
  console.log("Running Codey with args:", args);
  // Your logic here
}

// If this file is run directly (CLI mode), execute runCodey
if (require.main === module) {
  const args = process.argv.slice(2);
  runCodey(args);
}
```

This way, `runCodey` can be imported and used programmatically, or the script can be run as a CLI tool.

#### 6. TypeScript and Type Definitions
Since you’re using TypeScript (as seen in your scripts and dev dependencies), ensure you generate type declarations if you want TypeScript users to import your module with type safety. Add a `types` field to `package.json`:
```json
"types": "dist/codey.d.ts",
```
And configure your `tsconfig.json` to output declarations:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "declaration": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    // other options...
  }
}
```

Run `tsc` to generate the `.d.ts` files during the build step.

#### Final Updated `package.json`
Here’s how your updated `package.json` might look:
```json
{
  "name": "@codeybeaver/codey",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "LLMs on the command line.",
  "main": "dist/codey.js",
  "types": "dist/codey.d.ts",
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "import": "./dist/codey.js",
      "require": "./dist/codey.js"
    }
  },
  "bin": {
    "codey": "./dist/codey.js"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc && chmod +x dist/codey.js",
    "prepublishOnly": "pnpm run build",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
    "lint": "biome lint --write --unsafe",
    "format": "biome format --write",
    "fix": "pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run lint && pnpm run format"
  },
  "author": "Ryan X. Charles <ryan@ryanxcharles.com> (https://ryanxcharles.com)",
  "license": "MIT",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@biomejs/biome": "^1.0.0",
    "@types/node": "^24.0.3",
    "openai": "^5.5.1"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@iarna/toml": "^2.2.5",
    "@types/marked-terminal": "^6.1.1",
    "commander": "^14.0.0",
    "marked": "^15.0.12",
    "marked-terminal": "^7.3.0",
    "ora": "^8.2.0",
    "prettier": "^3.5.3",
    "yaml": "^2.8.0",
    "zod": "^3.25.48"
  }
}
```

### Summary
- Ensure `codey.js` exports something if you want to use it as a library via `import`.
- Update `package.json` with `main`, `exports`, and `types` for proper module resolution.
- Publish to npm (or use `npm link` for local testing) to enable `import "@codeybeaver/codey";`.
- Handle both CLI and library use cases in your code if needed.

If you just want to run the program as a CLI tool and not import it programmatically, you don’t need most of these changes—your `bin` field is already set up correctly. Let me know if you have a specific use case in mind (e.g., CLI-only vs. library), and I can refine the answer further!

i have decided to do it differently. i have put the program code into a file called program.ts which is built to dist/program.js. now, what you have to do to run it is like this:

```typescript
#!/usr/bin/env node
import { program } from "./program.js";
program.parse();
```

that is codey.js. now, when someone loads program.js from some other package, it should look something like this:

```typescript
import { program } from "@codeybeaver/codey/dist/program.js";
```
