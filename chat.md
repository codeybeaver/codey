# === ASSISTANT ===

Yes, it is possible to run or use your program `codey.js` by importing it in another program using `import "codey";`, but there are a few things you need to clarify and configure to make this work as expected. Let's break this down step by step.

### What Does `import "codey";` Mean?
When you write `import "codey";`, you're telling Node.js or a bundler (like webpack or rollup) to import a module named `codey`. This could refer to:
1. A local file or module in your project.
2. A package installed from npm (or another registry) with the name `codey` or `@codeybeaver/codey` (as defined in your `package.json`).

Since your `package.json` specifies `"name": "@codeybeaver/codey"`, I'll assume you want to publish this package to npm (or a private registry) and then import it in another project. If you just want to use it locally in another file, the steps are slightly different.

### Steps to Enable Importing Your Program

#### 1. Ensure Your Module is Exportable
If you want to use `import "codey";` or `import codey from "@codeybeaver/codey";`, your `codey.js` file (or the bundled output in `dist/codey.js`) must export something. For example:
- If `codey.js` is a library, it should export functions, classes, or objects.
- If `codey.js` is a CLI program, it might not export anything directly, but you can still make it executable via the `bin` field (which you already have).

Check your `codey.js` file. If it’s a CLI program, it might not need to export anything for direct imports, but if you want to use it as a library, ensure it has something like:
```javascript
// codey.js
export function runCodey() {
  console.log("Running Codey!");
  // Your program logic here
}

export default runCodey;
```

If you’re using TypeScript, make sure the compiled output in `dist/codey.js` reflects these exports.

#### 2. Update `package.json` for Module Support
Your `package.json` already has `"type": "module"`, which indicates that your project uses ES modules (ESM). This is good because it aligns with using `import` syntax. However, let’s ensure the `main` and `exports` fields are set up correctly.

- **Update `main` Field**: Your `main` field points to `"codey.js"`, which is fine if that’s the entry point for importing. However, since you have a `bin` field pointing to `./dist/codey.js`, it might be better to align `main` with the compiled output if applicable:
  ```json
  "main": "dist/codey.js",
  ```

- **Add `exports` Field (Optional but Recommended)**: The `exports` field provides a modern way to define entry points for your package. Update your `package.json` to include:
  ```json
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "import": "./dist/codey.js",
      "require": "./dist/codey.js"
    }
  },
  ```
  This tells tools like Node.js and bundlers where to find the entry point for both ESM (`import`) and CommonJS (`require`).

#### 3. Publish Your Package (If Needed)
If you want to use `import "codey";` or `import "@codeybeaver/codey";` in another project, you need to publish your package to npm or a private registry. Since your `package.json` has `"name": "@codeybeaver/codey"`, it’s scoped, which often implies a private or organization-specific package.

- Run `npm publish --access public` (or configure a private registry) to publish your package.
- After publishing, install it in another project using:
  ```bash
  npm install @codeybeaver/codey
  ```
- Then, in your TypeScript/JavaScript file, you can use:
  ```typescript
  import codey from "@codeybeaver/codey";
  codey(); // If it exports a function
  ```

#### 4. Local Development (If Not Publishing)
If you’re not ready to publish and just want to test locally in another project, you can use `npm link` or a local file path:
- In your `codey` project directory, run:
  ```bash
  npm link
  ```
- In the other project, run:
  ```bash
  npm link @codeybeaver/codey
  ```
- Then, you can import it as if it were published:
  ```typescript
  import codey from "@codeybeaver/codey";
  ```

Alternatively, if both projects are in the same monorepo or file system, you can reference the local path directly in the other project’s `package.json`:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "@codeybeaver/codey": "file:../path/to/codey"
}
```

#### 5. Handle CLI vs. Library Use Case
Your `package.json` has a `bin` field, which suggests `codey` is meant to be a CLI tool. If you run `npm install @codeybeaver/codey -g`, you can execute it directly from the command line as `codey` (thanks to the `bin` field). However, if you want to `import` it, ensure the code in `dist/codey.js` is structured to handle both CLI execution and programmatic imports.

For example, in `codey.js`, you can use a pattern like this:
```javascript
// codey.js
export function runCodey(args) {
  console.log("Running Codey with args:", args);
  // Your logic here
}

// If this file is run directly (CLI mode), execute runCodey
if (require.main === module) {
  const args = process.argv.slice(2);
  runCodey(args);
}
```

This way, `runCodey` can be imported and used programmatically, or the script can be run as a CLI tool.

#### 6. TypeScript and Type Definitions
Since you’re using TypeScript (as seen in your scripts and dev dependencies), ensure you generate type declarations if you want TypeScript users to import your module with type safety. Add a `types` field to `package.json`:
```json
"types": "dist/codey.d.ts",
```
And configure your `tsconfig.json` to output declarations:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "declaration": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    // other options...
  }
}
```

Run `tsc` to generate the `.d.ts` files during the build step.

#### Final Updated `package.json`
Here’s how your updated `package.json` might look:
```json
{
  "name": "@codeybeaver/codey",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "LLMs on the command line.",
  "main": "dist/codey.js",
  "types": "dist/codey.d.ts",
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "import": "./dist/codey.js",
      "require": "./dist/codey.js"
    }
  },
  "bin": {
    "codey": "./dist/codey.js"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc && chmod +x dist/codey.js",
    "prepublishOnly": "pnpm run build",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
    "lint": "biome lint --write --unsafe",
    "format": "biome format --write",
    "fix": "pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run lint && pnpm run format"
  },
  "author": "Ryan X. Charles <ryan@ryanxcharles.com> (https://ryanxcharles.com)",
  "license": "MIT",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@biomejs/biome": "^1.0.0",
    "@types/node": "^24.0.3",
    "openai": "^5.5.1"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@iarna/toml": "^2.2.5",
    "@types/marked-terminal": "^6.1.1",
    "commander": "^14.0.0",
    "marked": "^15.0.12",
    "marked-terminal": "^7.3.0",
    "ora": "^8.2.0",
    "prettier": "^3.5.3",
    "yaml": "^2.8.0",
    "zod": "^3.25.48"
  }
}
```

### Summary
- Ensure `codey.js` exports something if you want to use it as a library via `import`.
- Update `package.json` with `main`, `exports`, and `types` for proper module resolution.
- Publish to npm (or use `npm link` for local testing) to enable `import "@codeybeaver/codey";`.
- Handle both CLI and library use cases in your code if needed.

If you just want to run the program as a CLI tool and not import it programmatically, you don’t need most of these changes—your `bin` field is already set up correctly. Let me know if you have a specific use case in mind (e.g., CLI-only vs. library), and I can refine the answer further!

# === USER ===

do i need to modify my config somewhere to make typescript build and expose the types for this package?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Yes, if you want TypeScript to build and expose type definitions (`.d.ts` files) for your package so that other TypeScript projects can use it with type safety, you need to configure your TypeScript setup appropriately. This involves updating your `tsconfig.json` file to generate type declarations and ensuring that your `package.json` points to these type definitions. Let's go through the necessary steps.

### Steps to Build and Expose TypeScript Types

#### 1. Update `tsconfig.json` to Generate Type Declarations
Ensure your `tsconfig.json` is configured to output type declaration files (`.d.ts`) alongside your compiled JavaScript files. Here are the relevant options to include or verify in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // Enable declaration file generation
    "declaration": true,
    // Optionally, specify a directory for declaration files (if different from outDir)
    "declarationDir": "./dist",
    // Output directory for compiled JS and type declarations
    "outDir": "./dist",
    // Use ES modules (since your package.json has "type": "module")
    "module": "ESNext",
    // Target modern JavaScript (adjust based on your needs)
    "target": "ESNext",
    // Other useful options
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
  },
  "include": ["./codey.ts"], // Adjust based on your source file(s)
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

- **`"declaration": true`**: This tells TypeScript to generate `.d.ts` files for your source code.
- **`"declarationDir"`**: Specifies where to output the type declaration files. If omitted, they are placed alongside the compiled `.js` files in `outDir`.
- **`"outDir"`**: Specifies the directory for compiled output (both `.js` and `.d.ts` files).

If your source file is named `codey.ts` (or similar), ensure it’s included in the `"include"` array or matches the pattern for compilation.

#### 2. Update `package.json` to Reference Type Declarations
In your `package.json`, you’ve already added `"types": "dist/codey.d.ts"` (as suggested in the previous answer). This tells TypeScript and tools like IDEs where to find the type definitions for your package. Double-check that it matches the output path of your `.d.ts` files based on your `tsconfig.json` settings.

For example:
```json
{
  "main": "dist/codey.js",
  "types": "dist/codey.d.ts",
  "type": "module"
}
```

- If TypeScript outputs `dist/codey.d.ts` (based on `outDir` or `declarationDir`), this path is correct.
- If you have multiple entry points or a different structure, adjust accordingly.

#### 3. Ensure Your Build Script Compiles TypeScript
Your `package.json` already has a `"build": "tsc && chmod +x dist/codey.js"` script, which runs the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`). This will generate both the compiled JavaScript (`dist/codey.js`) and the type declarations (`dist/codey.d.ts`) if `"declaration": true` is set in `tsconfig.json`.

Run the build script to verify:
```bash
pnpm run build
```
After running, check the `dist` directory to ensure both `codey.js` and `codey.d.ts` are generated.

#### 4. Verify Exports in Source Code
Ensure your source file (`codey.ts` or similar) has proper exports so that TypeScript can generate meaningful type definitions. For example:

```typescript
// codey.ts
export function runCodey(args: string[] = []): void {
  console.log("Running Codey with args:", args);
  // Your logic here
}

export default runCodey;
```

The `export` statements will be reflected in the generated `codey.d.ts` file, allowing users to import and use your functions with type safety.

#### 5. Test Type Definitions Locally
Before publishing, test that the type definitions work correctly:
- Use `npm link` (as described in the previous answer) to link your package locally to another test project.
- In the test project, install your package via `npm link @codeybeaver/codey`.
- Import and use it in a TypeScript file to ensure autocompletion and type checking work in your IDE.

For example, in the test project:
```typescript
import runCodey from "@codeybeaver/codey";

runCodey(["test-arg"]); // Should show type hints if types are working
```

#### 6. Include Type Declarations in Published Package
When you publish your package to npm (or another registry), ensure the `dist` directory (containing both `.js` and `.d.ts` files) is included in the published artifacts. By default, npm includes all files in the package directory unless specified otherwise in a `.npmignore` file or the `"files"` field in `package.json`.

To be explicit, you can add a `"files"` field to `package.json` to ensure only necessary files are published:
```json
{
  "files": [
    "dist/**/*",
    "package.json",
    "README.md"
  ]
}
```

Run `npm publish --access public` (or equivalent) to publish your package, and the type definitions will be available to users.

#### 7. Optional: Separate Declaration Files for Complex Projects
If your project has multiple entry points or a complex structure, you might want to use `"declarationMap": true` in `tsconfig.json` to generate source maps for declarations (helpful for debugging). Additionally, consider using tools like `rollup` or `tsc` with a custom configuration to bundle type declarations into a single file if needed (e.g., using `dts-bundle` or similar plugins).

For most simple packages, the default `tsc` output with `"declaration": true` is sufficient.

### Example `tsconfig.json` for Your Project
Here’s a complete example of what your `tsconfig.json` might look like:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ESNext",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "declaration": true,
    "declarationDir": "./dist",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
  },
  "include": ["./codey.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

### Summary of Changes
- Add `"declaration": true` (and optionally `"declarationDir"`) to `tsconfig.json` to generate `.d.ts` files.
- Ensure your build script (`tsc`) runs and outputs both `.js` and `.d.ts` files to the `dist` directory.
- Verify `"types"` in `package.json` points to the correct `.d.ts` file (e.g., `dist/codey.d.ts`).
- Test locally with `npm link` or by installing in another project.
- Ensure the `dist` directory is included when publishing to npm.

If you already have a `tsconfig.json` file, please share it, and I can help tailor these instructions to your specific setup. Let me know if you encounter any issues with generating or using the type definitions!

the anthropic api seems to be different than openai and xai. xai supports the openai api, but anthropic gives me an error. how can i install the anthropic api and use it in this function? the purpose of this function is to stream the output of the LLM.

```typescript
export async function generateChatCompletionStream({
  messages,
  model,
}: {
  messages: { role: "assistant" | "user" | "system"; content: string }[];
  model: string;
}) {
  let aiApi: OpenAI;
  let baseURL: string | undefined;
  let apiKey: string | undefined;

  // Determine the provider based on the model
  const provider = getProvider(model);

  if (provider === "xai") {
    apiKey = process.env.XAI_API_KEY;
    baseURL = "https://api.x.ai/v1";
    if (!apiKey) {
      throw new Error("XAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set.");
    }
  } else if (provider === "anthropic") {
    apiKey = process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY;
    baseURL = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1";
    if (!apiKey) {
      throw new Error("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable is not set.");
    }
  } else if (provider === "openai") {
    apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
    // baseURL = "https://api.openai.com/v1";
    baseURL = undefined; // Use default OpenAI base URL
    if (!apiKey) {
      throw new Error("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set.");
    }
  } else {
    throw new Error(`Unsupported provider: ${provider}`);
  }

  aiApi = new OpenAI({
    apiKey,
    baseURL,
  });

  try {
    const stream = await withTimeout(
      aiApi.chat.completions.create({
        model,
        messages,
        max_tokens: undefined,
        stream: true,
      }),
      30_000, // 30 seconds timeout
    );
    return stream;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error generating chat completion:", error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```

# === ASSISTANT ===

You're correct that the Anthropic API differs from the OpenAI API (and XAI, which supports the OpenAI-compatible API). The `OpenAI` client from the `openai` library you're using is designed specifically for OpenAI's API structure, and Anthropic's API has a different endpoint structure, request format, and response handling, especially for streaming.

To integrate the Anthropic API for streaming output, you'll need to use Anthropic's official SDK, `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, which provides support for their API, including streaming capabilities. Below, I'll guide you through installing the Anthropic SDK and modifying your `generateChatCompletionStream` function to handle Anthropic's API alongside OpenAI and XAI.

### Step 1: Install the Anthropic SDK
First, you need to install the Anthropic SDK as a dependency in your project. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk
# or if using pnpm
pnpm add @anthropic-ai/sdk
```

This will add the Anthropic client library to your project. Make sure to include it in your `package.json` dependencies (not just devDependencies) if you plan to publish or use this package.

### Step 2: Update Your Code to Handle Anthropic API
Since the Anthropic API differs from OpenAI's, you can't use the `OpenAI` client for Anthropic models. Instead, you'll use the `Anthropic` client from `@anthropic-ai/sdk`. Anthropic's streaming API uses a different structure, and you'll need to adapt the logic to handle streaming responses.

Here's how you can modify your `generateChatCompletionStream` function to support Anthropic alongside OpenAI and XAI:

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";

// Utility function to handle timeouts (assuming you already have this)
async function withTimeout<T>(promise: Promise<T>, ms: number): Promise<T> {
  return Promise.race([
    promise,
    new Promise<T>((_, reject) =>
      setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Request timed out")), ms)
    ),
  ]);
}

// Function to determine provider from model (assuming you have this)
function getProvider(model: string): string {
  if (model.startsWith("claude-")) return "anthropic";
  if (model.startsWith("xai-")) return "xai";
  return "openai"; // Default to OpenAI for other models like gpt-*
}

export async function generateChatCompletionStream({
  messages,
  model,
}: {
  messages: { role: "assistant" | "user" | "system"; content: string }[];
  model: string;
}) {
  const provider = getProvider(model);

  if (provider === "anthropic") {
    const apiKey = process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY;
    if (!apiKey) {
      throw new Error("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable is not set.");
    }

    const anthropic = new Anthropic({
      apiKey,
    });

    try {
      const stream = await withTimeout(
        anthropic.messages.create({
          model,
          messages: messages.map((msg) => ({
            role: msg.role === "assistant" ? "assistant" : "user", // Anthropic only supports 'user' and 'assistant'
            content: msg.content,
          })),
          max_tokens: 4096, // Anthropic requires max_tokens to be set
          stream: true,
        }),
        30_000 // 30 seconds timeout
      );
      return stream; // Return the Anthropic stream (handle it differently in your consuming code)
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error generating Anthropic chat completion:", error);
      throw error;
    }
  } else {
    // Handle OpenAI or XAI (unchanged from your original code)
    let baseURL: string | undefined;
    let apiKey: string | undefined;

    if (provider === "xai") {
      apiKey = process.env.XAI_API_KEY;
      baseURL = "https://api.x.ai/v1";
      if (!apiKey) {
        throw new Error("XAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set.");
      }
    } else if (provider === "openai") {
      apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
      baseURL = undefined; // Use default OpenAI base URL
      if (!apiKey) {
        throw new Error("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set.");
      }
    } else {
      throw new Error(`Unsupported provider: ${provider}`);
    }

    const aiApi = new OpenAI({
      apiKey,
      baseURL,
    });

    try {
      const stream = await withTimeout(
        aiApi.chat.completions.create({
          model,
          messages,
          max_tokens: undefined,
          stream: true,
        }),
        30_000 // 30 seconds timeout
      );
      return stream;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error generating chat completion:", error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Differences and Adjustments for Anthropic
1. **Separate Client for Anthropic**:
   - The `Anthropic` client from `@anthropic-ai/sdk` is used for Anthropic models instead of the `OpenAI` client.
   - API key is passed directly to the `Anthropic` constructor.

2. **Message Format**:
   - Anthropic's API does not support the `system` role directly in the same way as OpenAI. Typically, system instructions are included as part of the first user message or handled separately. In this example, I map `system` to `user` for simplicity, but you might want to prepend system messages to the first user message for better results.
   - Adjust the message mapping logic if needed based on your use case.

3. **Streaming API**:
   - Anthropic's streaming API is accessed via `anthropic.messages.create` with `stream: true`.
   - The response structure for streaming differs from OpenAI. Anthropic returns events like `content_block_delta` for text streaming, which you'll need to handle in the code that consumes this stream.

4. **Required Parameters**:
   - Unlike OpenAI, Anthropic requires `max_tokens` to be set. I've hardcoded it to `4096` in this example, but you can make it configurable if needed.

### Step 3: Handle Streaming Output Differences
The streaming responses from OpenAI/XAI and Anthropic have different structures, so the code that consumes the `stream` returned by `generateChatCompletionStream` will need to handle both formats. Here's an example of how to process the streams:

```typescript
async function processStream(stream: any, provider: string) {
  if (provider === "anthropic") {
    // Handle Anthropic stream
    for await (const event of stream) {
      if (event.type === "content_block_delta") {
        const text = event.delta?.text || "";
        process.stdout.write(text); // Stream the text to console
      }
    }
  } else {
    // Handle OpenAI/XAI stream
    for await (const chunk of stream) {
      const text = chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content || "";
      process.stdout.write(text); // Stream the text to console
    }
  }
}

// Example usage
async function main() {
  const messages = [
    { role: "user", content: "Tell me a short story." },
  ];
  const model = "claude-3-opus-20240229"; // Anthropic model
  // const model = "gpt-4o"; // OpenAI model
  // const model = "xai-some-model"; // XAI model

  const provider = getProvider(model);
  const stream = await generateChatCompletionStream({ messages, model });
  await processStream(stream, provider);
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

- **OpenAI/XAI Stream**: The stream emits chunks with `choices[0].delta.content` for the text content.
- **Anthropic Stream**: The stream emits events, and text content is under `content_block_delta.delta.text`.

### Step 4: Update `package.json` Dependencies
Ensure the Anthropic SDK is listed in your `package.json` dependencies. After running the install command, it should appear as:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@anthropic-ai/sdk": "^0.27.3", // Use the latest version
  "openai": "^5.5.1",
  // other dependencies...
}
```

### Additional Notes
- **Error Handling**: Anthropic API errors might have a different structure than OpenAI errors. Ensure your error handling logic can accommodate both.
- **Rate Limits and Timeouts**: Anthropic may have different rate limits or behaviors compared to OpenAI. Adjust your `withTimeout` value or retry logic if needed.
- **System Messages**: If your application relies heavily on `system` messages, consider prepending them to the first user message for Anthropic, as their API doesn't natively support a separate `system` role in the same way.

### Summary
- Install `@anthropic-ai/sdk` to use the Anthropic API.
- Update your `generateChatCompletionStream` function to use the `Anthropic` client for Anthropic models and handle their streaming API.
- Adjust the consuming code to process Anthropic's streaming events differently from OpenAI/XAI.
- Ensure API keys are set in environment variables (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`).

# === USER ===

now there is a new problem. here is the code where i handled the stream itself, "awaiting" on each chunk:

```typescript
    for await (const c of withTimeout(stream, 15_000)) {
      if (c.choices[0]?.delta.content) {
        if (chunk) {
          process.stdout.write(
            `${JSON.stringify({ chunk: c.choices[0].delta.content })}\n`,
          );
        } else {
          process.stdout.write(c.choices[0].delta.content);
        }
      }
    }
```

this code now fails the typescheck, because anthropic returns something different than openai.

i think the best way to handle this is to change the generateChatCompletionStream function to return chunks of text. we somehow need to parse the output either for openai-compatible or anthropic models and then return plaintext. then the loop that uses this function doesn't need to worry about the differences in teh apis, and it will just handed chunks of text. make sense? can you make that change to the `generateChatCompletionStream` function?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Yes, it makes perfect sense to abstract the differences between the OpenAI/XAI and Anthropic APIs within the `generateChatCompletionStream` function and return a unified stream of text chunks. This way, the consuming code doesn't need to handle the structural differences between the APIs and can simply process plain text chunks. We can achieve this by transforming the raw API streams into a consistent format (e.g., an async iterable of text strings) regardless of the provider.

I'll update the `generateChatCompletionStream` function to return an async iterable of text chunks by processing the raw streams from OpenAI/XAI and Anthropic internally. This will ensure type safety and simplify the loop in your consuming code.

### Updated `generateChatCompletionStream` Function
Here's the modified version of the function that returns an async iterable of text chunks:

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";

// Utility function to handle timeouts
async function withTimeout<T>(promise: Promise<T>, ms: number): Promise<T> {
  return Promise.race([
    promise,
    new Promise<T>((_, reject) =>
      setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Request timed out")), ms)
    ),
  ]);
}

// Function to determine provider from model (adjust based on your logic)
function getProvider(model: string): string {
  if (model.startsWith("claude-")) return "anthropic";
  if (model.startsWith("xai-")) return "xai";
  return "openai"; // Default to OpenAI for other models like gpt-*
}

export async function generateChatCompletionStream({
  messages,
  model,
}: {
  messages: { role: "assistant" | "user" | "system"; content: string }[];
  model: string;
}): Promise<AsyncIterable<string>> {
  const provider = getProvider(model);

  if (provider === "anthropic") {
    const apiKey = process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY;
    if (!apiKey) {
      throw new Error("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable is not set.");
    }

    const anthropic = new Anthropic({
      apiKey,
    });

    try {
      const stream = await withTimeout(
        anthropic.messages.create({
          model,
          messages: messages.map((msg) => ({
            role: msg.role === "assistant" ? "assistant" : "user", // Anthropic only supports 'user' and 'assistant'
            content: msg.content,
          })),
          max_tokens: 4096, // Anthropic requires max_tokens to be set
          stream: true,
        }),
        30_000 // 30 seconds timeout
      );

      // Transform Anthropic stream into an async iterable of text chunks
      return {
        async *[Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
          for await (const event of stream) {
            if (event.type === "content_block_delta") {
              const text = event.delta?.text || "";
              if (text) yield text;
            }
          }
        },
      };
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error generating Anthropic chat completion:", error);
      throw error;
    }
  } else {
    // Handle OpenAI or XAI
    let baseURL: string | undefined;
    let apiKey: string | undefined;

    if (provider === "xai") {
      apiKey = process.env.XAI_API_KEY;
      baseURL = "https://api.x.ai/v1";
      if (!apiKey) {
        throw new Error("XAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set.");
      }
    } else if (provider === "openai") {
      apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
      baseURL = undefined; // Use default OpenAI base URL
      if (!apiKey) {
        throw new Error("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set.");
      }
    } else {
      throw new Error(`Unsupported provider: ${provider}`);
    }

    const aiApi = new OpenAI({
      apiKey,
      baseURL,
    });

    try {
      const stream = await withTimeout(
        aiApi.chat.completions.create({
          model,
          messages,
          max_tokens: undefined,
          stream: true,
        }),
        30_000 // 30 seconds timeout
      );

      // Transform OpenAI/XAI stream into an async iterable of text chunks
      return {
        async *[Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
          for await (const chunk of stream) {
            const text = chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content || "";
            if (text) yield text;
          }
        },
      };
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error generating chat completion:", error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **Return Type**:
   - The function now returns `Promise<AsyncIterable<string>>`, which is a promise that resolves to an async iterable of text chunks (strings). This ensures type safety and consistency across providers.

2. **Stream Transformation**:
   - For both Anthropic and OpenAI/XAI, the raw API stream is transformed into an async iterable using the `Symbol.asyncIterator` method.
   - For OpenAI/XAI, we extract text from `chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content`.
   - For Anthropic, we extract text from `event.delta?.text` when the event type is `content_block_delta`.
   - Only non-empty text chunks are yielded to avoid unnecessary iterations in the consuming code.

3. **Unified Output**:
   - Regardless of the provider, the consuming code will receive an async iterable of strings, abstracting away the differences in API response structures.

### Updated Consuming Code
Now, your loop that processes the stream can be simplified and will work the same way for any provider. Here's how you can update the code that handles the stream:

```typescript
async function processStream() {
  const messages = [
    { role: "user", content: "Tell me a short story." },
  ];
  const model = "claude-3-opus-20240229"; // Anthropic model
  // const model = "gpt-4o"; // OpenAI model
  // const model = "xai-some-model"; // XAI model

  const stream = await generateChatCompletionStream({ messages, model });

  // Use withTimeout if needed for the entire stream processing
  for await (const textChunk of withTimeout(stream, 15_000)) {
    if (textChunk) {
      // Replace 'chunk' with your desired flag or variable
      const chunk = false; // or true if you want JSON output
      if (chunk) {
        process.stdout.write(
          `${JSON.stringify({ chunk: textChunk })}\n`
        );
      } else {
        process.stdout.write(textChunk);
      }
    }
  }
}

processStream().catch(console.error);
```

### Key Points in the Consuming Code
- **Unified Handling**: The loop now iterates over `textChunk` (a string) directly, without worrying about the underlying API structure.
- **Type Safety**: Since `generateChatCompletionStream` returns `AsyncIterable<string>`, TypeScript will ensure that `textChunk` is always a string.
- **Timeout**: If you want to apply a timeout to the entire stream processing, you can still wrap the iterable with `withTimeout`. However, note that `withTimeout` might need to be adapted to work with iterables (or you can handle timeouts differently if needed).

### Adjusting `withTimeout` for Async Iterables (Optional)
If your `withTimeout` function isn't already set up to handle async iterables, here's a modified version that can wrap an async iterable with a timeout:

```typescript
async function withTimeout<T>(
  iterable: AsyncIterable<T>,
  ms: number
): Promise<AsyncIterable<T>> {
  return {
    async *[Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
      const iterator = iterable[Symbol.asyncIterator]();
      const timeoutPromise = new Promise<never>((_, reject) =>
        setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Stream timed out")), ms)
      );

      while (true) {
        const next = await Promise.race([iterator.next(), timeoutPromise]);
        if (next.done) break;
        yield next.value;
      }
    },
  };
}
```

This ensures that the entire stream processing stops if it exceeds the timeout period.

### Summary
- The `generateChatCompletionStream` function now returns an `AsyncIterable<string>`, providing a unified stream of text chunks for both OpenAI/XAI and Anthropic.
- The consuming code is simplified to iterate over text chunks without needing to handle API-specific structures.
- Type safety is maintained, and the differences between providers are abstracted away inside the function.

If you encounter any issues with this implementation or need further adjustments (e.g., handling specific error cases or additional providers), let me know!

# === USER ===

something is wrong. event.delta.text doesn't exist for anthropic.

here is there demo code from their docs:

```typescript
await client.messages.stream({
    messages: [{role: 'user', content: "Hello"}],
    model: 'claude-opus-4-20250514',
    max_tokens: 1024,
}).on('text', (text) => {
    console.log(text);
});
```

is there any way to mix the event-based API they demonstrate here with the async/await based approach in my code?

# === ASSISTANT ===

You're correct to point out the discrepancy. I apologize for the oversight. The Anthropic SDK's streaming API has evolved, and in the latest versions of `@anthropic-ai/sdk`, the streaming response structure and handling have changed. The `event.delta.text` path I mentioned earlier may not exist in the current API, or it might be specific to older versions or different event types. Looking at the demo code from Anthropic's documentation, they use an event-based API with `.stream()` and `.on('text', ...)` to handle streaming text content, which differs from the async iterable approach I suggested.

We can adapt your code to work with Anthropic's event-based streaming API while maintaining compatibility with the async/await and iterable approach used for OpenAI/XAI. The goal is to unify the output into an `AsyncIterable<string>` as before, but we'll handle Anthropic's streaming by converting their event-based system into an async iterable using a `ReadableStream` or a custom async generator.

Let's update the `generateChatCompletionStream` function to accommodate Anthropic's event-based streaming API.

### Updated `generateChatCompletionStream` Function
We'll use the `.stream()` method as shown in Anthropic's demo and transform the event-based stream into an async iterable. Here's how to do it:

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";

// Utility function to handle timeouts
async function withTimeout<T>(promise: Promise<T>, ms: number): Promise<T> {
  return Promise.race([
    promise,
    new Promise<T>((_, reject) =>
      setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Request timed out")), ms)
    ),
  ]);
}

// Function to determine provider from model (adjust based on your logic)
function getProvider(model: string): string {
  if (model.startsWith("claude-")) return "anthropic";
  if (model.startsWith("xai-")) return "xai";
  return "openai"; // Default to OpenAI for other models like gpt-*
}

export async function generateChatCompletionStream({
  messages,
  model,
}: {
  messages: { role: "assistant" | "user" | "system"; content: string }[];
  model: string;
}): Promise<AsyncIterable<string>> {
  const provider = getProvider(model);

  if (provider === "anthropic") {
    const apiKey = process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY;
    if (!apiKey) {
      throw new Error("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable is not set.");
    }

    const anthropic = new Anthropic({
      apiKey,
    });

    try {
      // Use Anthropic's stream method as shown in their demo
      const stream = await withTimeout(
        anthropic.messages.stream({
          model,
          messages: messages.map((msg) => ({
            role: msg.role === "assistant" ? "assistant" : "user", // Anthropic only supports 'user' and 'assistant'
            content: msg.content,
          })),
          max_tokens: 4096, // Anthropic requires max_tokens to be set
        }),
        30_000 // 30 seconds timeout
      );

      // Transform Anthropic's event-based stream into an async iterable
      return {
        async *[Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
          const textQueue: string[] = [];
          let resolveNext: ((value: IteratorResult<string>) => void) | null = null;
          let isDone = false;

          // Listen for 'text' events and queue the text chunks
          stream.on("text", (text) => {
            textQueue.push(text);
            if (resolveNext) {
              resolveNext({ value: textQueue.shift() as string, done: false });
              resolveNext = null;
            }
          });

          // Listen for 'end' event to signal completion
          stream.on("end", () => {
            isDone = true;
            if (resolveNext) {
              resolveNext({ value: "", done: true });
              resolveNext = null;
            }
          });

          // Handle errors
          stream.on("error", (error) => {
            isDone = true;
            if (resolveNext) {
              resolveNext({ value: "", done: true });
              // Ideally, throw the error to the iterator, but this is complex with events
              console.error("Anthropic stream error:", error);
            }
          });

          // Async iterator logic to yield text chunks
          while (!isDone || textQueue.length > 0) {
            if (textQueue.length > 0) {
              yield textQueue.shift() as string;
            } else if (!isDone) {
              // Wait for the next text event
              await new Promise<IteratorResult<string>>((resolve) => {
                resolveNext = resolve;
                if (isDone) {
                  resolve({ value: "", done: true });
                }
              });
            } else {
              break;
            }
          }
        },
      };
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error generating Anthropic chat completion:", error);
      throw error;
    }
  } else {
    // Handle OpenAI or XAI (unchanged)
    let baseURL: string | undefined;
    let apiKey: string | undefined;

    if (provider === "xai") {
      apiKey = process.env.XAI_API_KEY;
      baseURL = "https://api.x.ai/v1";
      if (!apiKey) {
        throw new Error("XAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set.");
      }
    } else if (provider === "openai") {
      apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
      baseURL = undefined; // Use default OpenAI base URL
      if (!apiKey) {
        throw new Error("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set.");
      }
    } else {
      throw new Error(`Unsupported provider: ${provider}`);
    }

    const aiApi = new OpenAI({
      apiKey,
      baseURL,
    });

    try {
      const stream = await withTimeout(
        aiApi.chat.completions.create({
          model,
          messages,
          max_tokens: undefined,
          stream: true,
        }),
        30_000 // 30 seconds timeout
      );

      // Transform OpenAI/XAI stream into an async iterable of text chunks
      return {
        async *[Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
          for await (const chunk of stream) {
            const text = chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content || "";
            if (text) yield text;
          }
        },
      };
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error generating chat completion:", error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Changes for Anthropic
1. **Using `.stream()` Method**:
   - As per Anthropic's demo, we use `anthropic.messages.stream()` instead of `create()` to initiate a streaming request. This returns an event emitter-like object that supports `.on('text', ...)` for receiving text chunks.

2. **Converting Events to Async Iterable**:
   - Since Anthropic's API is event-based, we need to bridge the gap between events and async/await. We create a custom async generator that listens for `text` events and yields the text chunks as they arrive.
   - We use a `textQueue` to store incoming text chunks and a `resolveNext` promise to handle the async waiting when no text is immediately available.
   - The `end` event signals that the stream is complete, and the `error` event logs errors (though error propagation in async iterables from events is tricky and may need additional handling based on your needs).

3. **Unified Output**:
   - The result is still an `AsyncIterable<string>`, so the consuming code remains unchanged and works the same way for OpenAI/XAI and Anthropic.

### Consuming Code (Unchanged)
Your existing code to process the stream remains the same, as the output is still an `AsyncIterable<string>`:

```typescript
async function processStream() {
  const messages = [
    { role: "user", content: "Tell me a short story." },
  ];
  const model = "claude-3-opus-20240229"; // Anthropic model
  // const model = "gpt-4o"; // OpenAI model
  // const model = "xai-some-model"; // XAI model

  const stream = await generateChatCompletionStream({ messages, model });

  for await (const textChunk of withTimeout(stream, 15_000)) {
    if (textChunk) {
      const chunk = false; // or true if you want JSON output
      if (chunk) {
        process.stdout.write(
          `${JSON.stringify({ chunk: textChunk })}\n`
        );
      } else {
        process.stdout.write(textChunk);
      }
    }
  }
}

processStream().catch(console.error);
```

### Notes on Error Handling
- The current implementation logs errors from Anthropic's `error` event but doesn't propagate them directly to the async iterable's consumer. Propagating errors from an event-based system to an async iterator is complex because events can occur asynchronously outside the iterator's control. If error handling is critical, you might need to use a different pattern (e.g., wrapping the stream in a promise that rejects on error) or manually throw errors by storing them in a variable and checking in the iterator.
- If you need robust error handling, let me know, and I can suggest an alternative approach.

### Alternative Approach (Optional)
If the event-to-iterable conversion feels too complex or error-prone, an alternative is to use Anthropic's non-streaming API (`anthropic.messages.create`) with `stream: false` and return a single chunk of text as an iterable. However, this would defeat the purpose of streaming. Another option is to check if newer versions of `@anthropic-ai/sdk` support async iterables directly (some SDKs are moving toward this).

You can also explore Anthropic's raw event types by logging them to understand the structure better:
```typescript
stream.on("event", (event) => console.log("Raw event:", event));
```

### Dependency Check
Ensure you have the latest version of `@anthropic-ai/sdk` installed, as the API might differ across versions:
```bash
npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk@latest
# or
pnpm add @anthropic-ai/sdk@latest
```

### Summary
- Updated `generateChatCompletionStream` to use Anthropic's `.stream()` method with event listeners for text streaming.
- Converted Anthropic's event-based API into an `AsyncIterable<string>` to maintain compatibility with async/await loops.
- Kept the consuming code unchanged by abstracting provider differences.

If you run into issues with this implementation (e.g., specific event types or errors), or if Anthropic's SDK behaves differently in your environment, please share the error or logs, and I can refine the solution further!

# === USER ===

this code doesn't quite work for anthropic. i tried a console.log, and the text is being received, but somehow it's not "returned" by the function correctly. my code that uses this can't see the output from anthropic. do you see the issue?

```
export async function generateChatCompletionStream({
  messages,
  model,
}: {
  messages: { role: "assistant" | "user" | "system"; content: string }[];
  model: string;
}): Promise<AsyncIterable<string>> {
  const provider = getProvider(model);

  if (provider === "anthropic") {
    const apiKey = process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY;
    if (!apiKey) {
      throw new Error("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable is not set.");
    }

    const anthropic = new Anthropic({
      apiKey,
    });

    try {
      const stream = anthropic.messages.stream({
        model,

        async *[Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
          const textQueue: string[] = [];
          let resolveNext: ((value: IteratorResult<string>) => void) | null =
            null;
          let isDone = false;

# === ASSISTANT ===

I can see the issue with the Anthropic streaming implementation in your code. The problem lies in the way the async iterator handles the event-based streaming from Anthropic. Even though you're seeing the text chunks being received (via `console.log`), they're not being properly yielded to the consuming code. The issue is in the logic for waiting and resolving the next chunk in the async iterator. Specifically, the `Promise` in the `await new Promise<IteratorResult<string>>` block isn't being resolved correctly when new text arrives because the `resolveNext` function isn't always invoked as expected after the initial setup.

The current implementation has a race condition and a logic flaw in how it waits for new text chunks. When `resolveNext` is set, it may not be called if text arrives before the `await` block is reached, or if `isDone` is set prematurely. Let's fix this by restructuring the async iterator to properly handle the event-driven nature of Anthropic's stream. We'll use a more robust way to bridge the event-based API to an async iterable by ensuring that every text chunk in the queue is yielded and that the waiting mechanism works correctly.

### Updated `generateChatCompletionStream` Function
Here's the corrected version of the function with a better handling of Anthropic's event-based stream into an async iterable:

```typescript
import OpenAI from "openai";
import Anthropic from "@anthropic-ai/sdk";

// Utility function to handle timeouts
async function withTimeout<T>(promise: Promise<T>, ms: number): Promise<T> {
  return Promise.race([
    promise,
    new Promise<T>((_, reject) =>
      setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Request timed out")), ms)
    ),
  ]);
}

// Function to determine provider from model (adjust based on your logic)
function getProvider(model: string): string {
  if (model.startsWith("claude-")) return "anthropic";
  if (model.startsWith("xai-")) return "xai";
  return "openai"; // Default to OpenAI for other models like gpt-*
}

export async function generateChatCompletionStream({
  messages,
  model,
}: {
  messages: { role: "assistant" | "user" | "system"; content: string }[];
  model: string;
}): Promise<AsyncIterable<string>> {
  const provider = getProvider(model);

  if (provider === "anthropic") {
    const apiKey = process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY;
    if (!apiKey) {
      throw new Error("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable is not set.");
    }

    const anthropic = new Anthropic({
      apiKey,
    });

    try {
      const stream = await withTimeout(
        anthropic.messages.stream({
          model,
          messages: messages.map((msg) => ({
            role: msg.role === "assistant" ? "assistant" : "user", // Anthropic only supports 'user' and 'assistant'
            content: msg.content,
          })),
          max_tokens: 4096, // Anthropic requires max_tokens to be set
        }),
        30_000 // 30 seconds timeout
      );

      // Transform Anthropic stream into an async iterable of text chunks
      return {
        async *[Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
          const textQueue: string[] = [];
          let isDone = false;
          let error: Error | null = null;
          let pendingResolve: ((value: IteratorResult<string>) => void) | null = null;

          // Listen for 'text' events and queue the text chunks
          stream.on("text", (text) => {
            if (text) {
              textQueue.push(text);
              if (pendingResolve) {
                const chunk = textQueue.shift();
                if (chunk) {
                  pendingResolve({ value: chunk, done: false });
                  pendingResolve = null;
                }
              }
            }
          });

          // Listen for 'end' event to signal completion
          stream.on("end", () => {
            isDone = true;
            if (pendingResolve) {
              pendingResolve({ value: "", done: true });
              pendingResolve = null;
            }
          });

          // Handle errors
          stream.on("error", (err) => {
            isDone = true;
            error = err instanceof Error ? err : new Error(String(err));
            if (pendingResolve) {
              pendingResolve({ value: "", done: true });
              pendingResolve = null;
            }
          });

          // Async iterator logic to yield text chunks
          try {
            while (true) {
              if (error) {
                throw error; // Propagate error to the consumer if one occurred
              }
              if (textQueue.length > 0) {
                const chunk = textQueue.shift();
                if (chunk) {
                  yield chunk;
                }
              } else if (isDone) {
                break; // Exit loop if stream is done and no more chunks
              } else {
                // Wait for the next text event or completion
                const result = await new Promise<IteratorResult<string>>((resolve) => {
                  pendingResolve = resolve;
                  if (isDone) {
                    resolve({ value: "", done: true });
                  } else if (textQueue.length > 0) {
                    const chunk = textQueue.shift();
                    if (chunk) {
                      resolve({ value: chunk, done: false });
                    }
                  }
                });
                if (result.done) {
                  break;
                }
                yield result.value;
              }
            }
          } finally {
            // Clean up event listeners to prevent memory leaks
            stream.off("text");
            stream.off("end");
            stream.off("error");
          }
        },
      };
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Error generating Anthropic chat completion:", error);
      throw error;
    }
  } else {
    // Handle OpenAI or XAI

    let apiKey: string | undefined;

    if (provider === "xai") {
      apiKey = process.env.XAI_API_KEY;
      baseURL = "https://api.x.ai/v1";
      if (!apiKey) {
        throw new Error("XAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set.");
      }
    } else if (provider === "openai") {
      apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
      baseURL = undefined; // Use default OpenAI base URL
      if (!apiKey) {

      }
    } else {
      throw new Error(`Unsupported provider: ${provider}`);
    }

    const aiApi = new OpenAI({
      apiKey,
      baseURL,
    });

    try {
      const stream = await withTimeout(
        aiApi.chat.completions.create({
          model,
          messages,
          max_tokens: undefined,
          stream: true,
        }),
        30_000 // 30 seconds timeout
      );

      // Transform OpenAI/XAI stream into an async iterable of text chunks
      return {
        async *[Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
          for await (const chunk of stream) {
            const text = chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content || "";
            if (text) {
              yield text;

    } catch (error) {

      throw error;
    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Fixes
The primary issue in the previous code was in the async iterator's logic for waiting on new text chunks. The `resolveNext` (now `pendingResolve`) wasn't always cleared or triggered correctly, leading to a situation where the iterator could get stuck waiting for a resolution that never came, even though text chunks were being received. Here's what I changed:

1. **Improved Promise Resolution Logic**:
   - The `pendingResolve` function is now set only when we explicitly wait for a new chunk or completion. If text is already in the queue or the stream is done, we resolve immediately.
   - When a text event arrives, we check if there's a pending resolve and immediately resolve it with the next chunk from the queue.

2. **Better Loop Control**:
   - The `while (true)` loop now explicitly checks for `isDone` and the queue state to decide whether to yield a chunk or break.
   - If an error occurs, it's stored and thrown to the consumer, ensuring proper error propagation.

3. **Event Listener Cleanup**:
   - Added a `finally` block to remove event listeners (`stream.off()`) to prevent memory leaks after the iterator is done or an error occurs.

4. **Timeout Handling**:
   - The `withTimeout` wrapper is applied to the initial `stream` creation to ensure the request doesn't hang indefinitely. If you still need a timeout for the entire streaming process, you can apply it in the consuming code.

### Debugging Tip
If you're still not seeing output, uncomment or add a `console.log` inside the `stream.on("text", ...)` handler to confirm that text chunks are being received and added to the queue:

```typescript
stream.on("text", (text) => {
  console.log("Received text chunk:", text);
  textQueue.push(text);
  if (pendingResolve) {
    const chunk = textQueue.shift();
    if (chunk) {
      pendingResolve({ value: chunk, done: false });
      pendingResolve = null;
    }
  }
});
```

Additionally, add a log in the iterator loop to see if it's yielding chunks:

```typescript
if (textQueue.length > 0) {
  const chunk = textQueue.shift();
  if (chunk) {
    console.log("Yielding chunk:", chunk);
    yield chunk;
  }
}
```

### Consuming Code (Unchanged)
Your consuming code should now work as expected with the corrected iterator:

```typescript
async function processStream() {
  const messages = [
    { role: "user", content: "Tell me a short story." },
  ];
  const model = "claude-3-opus-20240229"; // Anthropic model
  // const model = "gpt-4o"; // OpenAI model
  // const model = "xai-some-model"; // XAI model

  const stream = await generateChatCompletionStream({ messages, model });

  for await (const textChunk of withTimeout(stream, 15_000)) {
    if (textChunk) {
      const chunk = false; // or true if you want JSON output
      if (chunk) {
        process.stdout.write(`${JSON.stringify({ chunk: textChunk })}\n`);
      } else {
        process.stdout.write(textChunk);
      }
    }
  }
}

processStream().catch(console.error);
```

### Additional Debugging and Fallback
If the issue persists, it might be due to a version mismatch or specific behavior in the `@anthropic-ai/sdk`. Check your installed version (`npm list @anthropic-ai/sdk`) and ensure it's up to date (`npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk@latest`). You can also log all events to understand the structure:

```typescript
stream.on("event", (event) => {
  console.log("Raw Anthropic event:", event);
});
```

As a fallback, if the event-based approach continues to fail, you might consider using Anthropic's non-streaming API temporarily to debug:

```typescript
const response = await anthropic.messages.create({
  model,
  messages: messages.map((msg) => ({
    role: msg.role === "assistant" ? "assistant" : "user",
    content: msg.content,
  })),
  max_tokens: 4096,
  stream: false,
});
return {
  async *[Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
    yield response.content[0].text || "";
  },
};
```

This won't stream the output but will confirm if the API key and model are working correctly.

### Summary
- Fixed the async iterator logic for Anthropic by ensuring proper resolution of pending promises and yielding of text chunks.
- Added error propagation and event listener cleanup for robustness.
- Suggested debugging logs to confirm text chunk processing.

If you're still not seeing output in the consuming code, please share the output of the debug logs or any errors you encounter, and I'll help pinpoint the issue further!
