Yes, it is possible to run or use your program `codey.js` by importing it in another program using `import "codey";`, but there are a few things you need to clarify and configure to make this work as expected. Let's break this down step by step.

### What Does `import "codey";` Mean?
When you write `import "codey";`, you're telling Node.js or a bundler (like webpack or rollup) to import a module named `codey`. This could refer to:
1. A local file or module in your project.
2. A package installed from npm (or another registry) with the name `codey` or `@codeybeaver/codey` (as defined in your `package.json`).

Since your `package.json` specifies `"name": "@codeybeaver/codey"`, I'll assume you want to publish this package to npm (or a private registry) and then import it in another project. If you just want to use it locally in another file, the steps are slightly different.

### Steps to Enable Importing Your Program

#### 1. Ensure Your Module is Exportable
If you want to use `import "codey";` or `import codey from "@codeybeaver/codey";`, your `codey.js` file (or the bundled output in `dist/codey.js`) must export something. For example:
- If `codey.js` is a library, it should export functions, classes, or objects.
- If `codey.js` is a CLI program, it might not export anything directly, but you can still make it executable via the `bin` field (which you already have).

Check your `codey.js` file. If it’s a CLI program, it might not need to export anything for direct imports, but if you want to use it as a library, ensure it has something like:
```javascript
// codey.js
export function runCodey() {
  console.log("Running Codey!");
  // Your program logic here
}

export default runCodey;
```

If you’re using TypeScript, make sure the compiled output in `dist/codey.js` reflects these exports.

#### 2. Update `package.json` for Module Support
Your `package.json` already has `"type": "module"`, which indicates that your project uses ES modules (ESM). This is good because it aligns with using `import` syntax. However, let’s ensure the `main` and `exports` fields are set up correctly.

- **Update `main` Field**: Your `main` field points to `"codey.js"`, which is fine if that’s the entry point for importing. However, since you have a `bin` field pointing to `./dist/codey.js`, it might be better to align `main` with the compiled output if applicable:
  ```json
  "main": "dist/codey.js",
  ```

- **Add `exports` Field (Optional but Recommended)**: The `exports` field provides a modern way to define entry points for your package. Update your `package.json` to include:
  ```json
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "import": "./dist/codey.js",
      "require": "./dist/codey.js"
    }
  },
  ```
  This tells tools like Node.js and bundlers where to find the entry point for both ESM (`import`) and CommonJS (`require`).

#### 3. Publish Your Package (If Needed)
If you want to use `import "codey";` or `import "@codeybeaver/codey";` in another project, you need to publish your package to npm or a private registry. Since your `package.json` has `"name": "@codeybeaver/codey"`, it’s scoped, which often implies a private or organization-specific package.

- Run `npm publish --access public` (or configure a private registry) to publish your package.
- After publishing, install it in another project using:
  ```bash
  npm install @codeybeaver/codey
  ```
- Then, in your TypeScript/JavaScript file, you can use:
  ```typescript
  import codey from "@codeybeaver/codey";
  codey(); // If it exports a function
  ```

#### 4. Local Development (If Not Publishing)
If you’re not ready to publish and just want to test locally in another project, you can use `npm link` or a local file path:
- In your `codey` project directory, run:
  ```bash
  npm link
  ```
- In the other project, run:
  ```bash
  npm link @codeybeaver/codey
  ```
- Then, you can import it as if it were published:
  ```typescript
  import codey from "@codeybeaver/codey";
  ```

Alternatively, if both projects are in the same monorepo or file system, you can reference the local path directly in the other project’s `package.json`:
```json
"dependencies": {
  "@codeybeaver/codey": "file:../path/to/codey"
}
```

#### 5. Handle CLI vs. Library Use Case
Your `package.json` has a `bin` field, which suggests `codey` is meant to be a CLI tool. If you run `npm install @codeybeaver/codey -g`, you can execute it directly from the command line as `codey` (thanks to the `bin` field). However, if you want to `import` it, ensure the code in `dist/codey.js` is structured to handle both CLI execution and programmatic imports.

For example, in `codey.js`, you can use a pattern like this:
```javascript
// codey.js
export function runCodey(args) {
  console.log("Running Codey with args:", args);
  // Your logic here
}

// If this file is run directly (CLI mode), execute runCodey
if (require.main === module) {
  const args = process.argv.slice(2);
  runCodey(args);
}
```

This way, `runCodey` can be imported and used programmatically, or the script can be run as a CLI tool.

#### 6. TypeScript and Type Definitions
Since you’re using TypeScript (as seen in your scripts and dev dependencies), ensure you generate type declarations if you want TypeScript users to import your module with type safety. Add a `types` field to `package.json`:
```json
"types": "dist/codey.d.ts",
```
And configure your `tsconfig.json` to output declarations:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "declaration": true,
    "outDir": "dist",
    // other options...
  }
}
```

Run `tsc` to generate the `.d.ts` files during the build step.

#### Final Updated `package.json`
Here’s how your updated `package.json` might look:
```json
{
  "name": "@codeybeaver/codey",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "LLMs on the command line.",
  "main": "dist/codey.js",
  "types": "dist/codey.d.ts",
  "type": "module",
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "import": "./dist/codey.js",
      "require": "./dist/codey.js"
    }
  },
  "bin": {
    "codey": "./dist/codey.js"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc && chmod +x dist/codey.js",
    "prepublishOnly": "pnpm run build",
    "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
    "lint": "biome lint --write --unsafe",
    "format": "biome format --write",
    "fix": "pnpm run typecheck && pnpm run lint && pnpm run format"
  },
  "author": "Ryan X. Charles <ryan@ryanxcharles.com> (https://ryanxcharles.com)",
  "license": "MIT",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@biomejs/biome": "^1.0.0",
    "@types/node": "^24.0.3",
    "openai": "^5.5.1"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@iarna/toml": "^2.2.5",
    "@types/marked-terminal": "^6.1.1",
    "commander": "^14.0.0",
    "marked": "^15.0.12",
    "marked-terminal": "^7.3.0",
    "ora": "^8.2.0",
    "prettier": "^3.5.3",
    "yaml": "^2.8.0",
    "zod": "^3.25.48"
  }
}
```

### Summary
- Ensure `codey.js` exports something if you want to use it as a library via `import`.
- Update `package.json` with `main`, `exports`, and `types` for proper module resolution.
- Publish to npm (or use `npm link` for local testing) to enable `import "@codeybeaver/codey";`.
- Handle both CLI and library use cases in your code if needed.

If you just want to run the program as a CLI tool and not import it programmatically, you don’t need most of these changes—your `bin` field is already set up correctly. Let me know if you have a specific use case in mind (e.g., CLI-only vs. library), and I can refine the answer further!

# === USER ===

do i need to modify my config somewhere to make typescript build and expose the types for this package?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Yes, if you want TypeScript to build and expose type definitions (`.d.ts` files) for your package so that other TypeScript projects can use it with type safety, you need to configure your TypeScript setup appropriately. This involves updating your `tsconfig.json` file to generate type declarations and ensuring that your `package.json` points to these type definitions. Let's go through the necessary steps.

### Steps to Build and Expose TypeScript Types

#### 1. Update `tsconfig.json` to Generate Type Declarations
Ensure your `tsconfig.json` is configured to output type declaration files (`.d.ts`) alongside your compiled JavaScript files. Here are the relevant options to include or verify in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // Enable declaration file generation
    "declaration": true,
    // Optionally, specify a directory for declaration files (if different from outDir)
    "declarationDir": "./dist",
    // Output directory for compiled JS and type declarations
    "outDir": "./dist",
    // Use ES modules (since your package.json has "type": "module")
    "module": "ESNext",
    // Target modern JavaScript (adjust based on your needs)
    "target": "ESNext",
    // Other useful options
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
  },
  "include": ["./codey.ts"], // Adjust based on your source file(s)
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

- **`"declaration": true`**: This tells TypeScript to generate `.d.ts` files for your source code.
- **`"declarationDir"`**: Specifies where to output the type declaration files. If omitted, they are placed alongside the compiled `.js` files in `outDir`.
- **`"outDir"`**: Specifies the directory for compiled output (both `.js` and `.d.ts` files).

If your source file is named `codey.ts` (or similar), ensure it’s included in the `"include"` array or matches the pattern for compilation.

#### 2. Update `package.json` to Reference Type Declarations
In your `package.json`, you’ve already added `"types": "dist/codey.d.ts"` (as suggested in the previous answer). This tells TypeScript and tools like IDEs where to find the type definitions for your package. Double-check that it matches the output path of your `.d.ts` files based on your `tsconfig.json` settings.

For example:
```json
{
  "main": "dist/codey.js",
  "types": "dist/codey.d.ts",
  "type": "module"
}
```

- If TypeScript outputs `dist/codey.d.ts` (based on `outDir` or `declarationDir`), this path is correct.
- If you have multiple entry points or a different structure, adjust accordingly.

#### 3. Ensure Your Build Script Compiles TypeScript
Your `package.json` already has a `"build": "tsc && chmod +x dist/codey.js"` script, which runs the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`). This will generate both the compiled JavaScript (`dist/codey.js`) and the type declarations (`dist/codey.d.ts`) if `"declaration": true` is set in `tsconfig.json`.

Run the build script to verify:
```bash
pnpm run build
```
After running, check the `dist` directory to ensure both `codey.js` and `codey.d.ts` are generated.

#### 4. Verify Exports in Source Code
Ensure your source file (`codey.ts` or similar) has proper exports so that TypeScript can generate meaningful type definitions. For example:

```typescript
// codey.ts
export function runCodey(args: string[] = []): void {
  console.log("Running Codey with args:", args);
  // Your logic here
}

export default runCodey;
```

The `export` statements will be reflected in the generated `codey.d.ts` file, allowing users to import and use your functions with type safety.

#### 5. Test Type Definitions Locally
Before publishing, test that the type definitions work correctly:
- Use `npm link` (as described in the previous answer) to link your package locally to another test project.
- In the test project, install your package via `npm link @codeybeaver/codey`.
- Import and use it in a TypeScript file to ensure autocompletion and type checking work in your IDE.

For example, in the test project:
```typescript
import runCodey from "@codeybeaver/codey";

runCodey(["test-arg"]); // Should show type hints if types are working
```

#### 6. Include Type Declarations in Published Package
When you publish your package to npm (or another registry), ensure the `dist` directory (containing both `.js` and `.d.ts` files) is included in the published artifacts. By default, npm includes all files in the package directory unless specified otherwise in a `.npmignore` file or the `"files"` field in `package.json`.

To be explicit, you can add a `"files"` field to `package.json` to ensure only necessary files are published:
```json
{
  "files": [
    "dist/**/*",
    "package.json",
    "README.md"
  ]
}
```

Run `npm publish --access public` (or equivalent) to publish your package, and the type definitions will be available to users.

#### 7. Optional: Separate Declaration Files for Complex Projects
If your project has multiple entry points or a complex structure, you might want to use `"declarationMap": true` in `tsconfig.json` to generate source maps for declarations (helpful for debugging). Additionally, consider using tools like `rollup` or `tsc` with a custom configuration to bundle type declarations into a single file if needed (e.g., using `dts-bundle` or similar plugins).

For most simple packages, the default `tsc` output with `"declaration": true` is sufficient.

### Example `tsconfig.json` for Your Project
Here’s a complete example of what your `tsconfig.json` might look like:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ESNext",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "declaration": true,
    "declarationDir": "./dist",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
  },
  "include": ["./codey.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

### Summary of Changes
- Add `"declaration": true` (and optionally `"declarationDir"`) to `tsconfig.json` to generate `.d.ts` files.
- Ensure your build script (`tsc`) runs and outputs both `.js` and `.d.ts` files to the `dist` directory.
- Verify `"types"` in `package.json` points to the correct `.d.ts` file (e.g., `dist/codey.d.ts`).
- Test locally with `npm link` or by installing in another project.
- Ensure the `dist` directory is included when publishing to npm.

If you already have a `tsconfig.json` file, please share it, and I can help tailor these instructions to your specific setup. Let me know if you encounter any issues with generating or using the type definitions!

the anthropic api seems to be different than openai and xai. xai supports the openai api, but anthropic gives me an error. how can i install the anthropic api and use it in this function? the purpose of this function is to stream the output of the LLM.

```typescript
export async function generateChatCompletionStream({
  messages,
  model,
}: {
  messages: { role: "assistant" | "user" | "system"; content: string }[];
  model: string;
}) {
  let aiApi: OpenAI;
  let baseURL: string | undefined;
  let apiKey: string | undefined;

  // Determine the provider based on the model
  const provider = getProvider(model);

  if (provider === "xai") {
    apiKey = process.env.XAI_API_KEY;
    baseURL = "https://api.x.ai/v1";
    if (!apiKey) {
      throw new Error("XAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set.");
    }
  } else if (provider === "anthropic") {
    apiKey = process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY;
    baseURL = "https://api.anthropic.com/v1";
    if (!apiKey) {
      throw new Error("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY environment variable is not set.");
    }
  } else if (provider === "openai") {
    apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
    // baseURL = "https://api.openai.com/v1";
    baseURL = undefined; // Use default OpenAI base URL
    if (!apiKey) {
      throw new Error("OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable is not set.");
    }
  } else {
    throw new Error(`Unsupported provider: ${provider}`);
  }

  aiApi = new OpenAI({
    apiKey,
    baseURL,
  });

  try {
    const stream = await withTimeout(
      aiApi.chat.completions.create({
        model,
        messages,
        max_tokens: undefined,
        stream: true,
      }),
      30_000, // 30 seconds timeout
    );
    return stream;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error generating chat completion:", error);
    throw error;
  }
}
```
