is there a "website" config setting in a package.json file for npm packages?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Yes, there is no official or standardized `"website"` field in the `package.json` file for npm packages. The `package.json` file is primarily used to define metadata about an npm package, such as its name, version, dependencies, scripts, and other relevant information. While you can add custom fields to `package.json`, `"website"` is not a recognized or commonly used field by npm or the Node.js ecosystem.

However, there are related fields in `package.json` that are often used to provide information about a package's online presence or documentation:

1. **`homepage`**: This is the standard field used to specify the URL of the project's homepage or website. Many tools, including npm's website, will display this link for users to visit the project's main site.
   ```json
   {
     "homepage": "https://example.com"
   }
   ```

2. **`repository`**: This field is used to specify the location of the project's source code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). It often includes a URL, and npm will link to it on the package's page.
   ```json
   {
     "repository": {
       "type": "git",
       "url": "git+https://github.com/user/repo.git"
     }
   }
   ```

If you want to include a custom `"website"` field in your `package.json`, you can do so since `package.json` allows arbitrary key-value pairs. However, it won't be recognized or used by npm or other tools unless you write custom logic to handle it.

### Example with Custom `"website"` Field
```json
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "homepage": "https://example.com",
  "website": "https://my-custom-website.com",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "git+https://github.com/user/repo.git"
  }
}
```

In most cases, using the `"homepage"` field is the recommended way to link to a project's website, as it is a standard field supported by npm and displayed on the npm registry. If you have additional URLs or custom needs, you can include them as custom fields or in the `"repository"` or `"bugs"` fields (for issue trackers).
